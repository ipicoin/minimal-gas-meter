## Minimalist Gas Metering Module for Smart Contract Simulation in Browsers

To enable running smart contract code in a browser for simulation purposes prior to executing a transaction, as well as for debugging, a minimalist gas metering module is required. This module must be as lightweight as possible to ensure efficient loading and execution within the browser. To achieve this, the gas metering code was written in pure C, resulting in a compact WebAssembly module.

The project also includes a program that demonstrates the practical use of the gas meter. This program transforms WebAssembly code and executes it using the WAVM virtual machine.

### 1. **Purpose and Application**

Gas metering plays a critical role in the context of smart contracts, particularly within blockchain ecosystems like Ethereum. Gas serves as a unit that measures computational resource consumption during the execution of transactions or contract code. Proper gas management ensures that smart contracts do not exceed predefined limits, preventing network congestion or failed transactions.

The ability to simulate and measure gas usage is essential for both developers and users. Key benefits include:
- **Cost Estimation:** Simulation helps determine the cost of executing a contract before deployment, avoiding unexpected expenses.
- **Error Prevention:** By measuring gas usage beforehand, developers can identify areas where code may exceed limits and optimize accordingly.
- **Debugging:** Debugging contracts in a browser simplifies the development process, enabling faster identification and resolution of errors.

### 2. **Technology Choices**

To meet the project's requirements for performance, size, and compatibility, several key technology choices were made:

#### **Why C?**
C was chosen for its ability to produce highly optimized, low-level code with minimal overhead. By writing the gas metering logic in C, the resulting WebAssembly module remains compact and efficient, allowing for quick loading and execution in browser environments.

#### **Why WebAssembly?**
WebAssembly (WASM) is a binary instruction format designed for high performance in web applications. It is:
- **Lightweight:** Ideal for resource-constrained environments like browsers.
- **Fast:** Offers near-native performance, critical for real-time gas simulations.
- **Portable:** Runs seamlessly across all modern browsers without additional dependencies.

This combination of C and WebAssembly ensures that the gas metering module achieves the desired balance between functionality and efficiency, making it suitable for deployment in environments where resources are limited.

### 3. **Technical Details of Operation**

The gas metering module works by processing WebAssembly code and injecting external function calls to `useGas`. The main steps involved are as follows:

1. **Code Analysis:**  
   The module analyzes WebAssembly code to identify instructions or operations that consume significant computational resources. Examples include:
    - Loops or iterative constructs.
    - Complex arithmetic operations.
    - Memory allocation or manipulation.

2. **Injection of `useGas` Calls:**  
   The `useGas` function is inserted into the WebAssembly code at strategic points. This function performs the following:
    - **Gas Counter Increment:** Updates the gas usage counter based on the operationâ€™s resource requirements.
    - **Execution Halt:** Interrupts the code execution if the gas limit is exceeded, preventing further processing.

3. **Performance Considerations:**  
   The lightweight nature of the module ensures minimal overhead during simulation. Additionally, the injected calls to `useGas` are designed to be efficient, avoiding unnecessary delays in execution.

#### **DWARF Debugging Support:**
For debugging purposes, maintaining DWARF debugging information in the modified WebAssembly code is essential. This ensures compatibility with tools like Chrome DevTools, enabling developers to step through their original source code while analyzing gas usage.

TODO: Due to the ability to debug WebAssembly code in Chrome, which relies on DWARF information, it is necessary to develop a second, larger module. This module will inject useGas calls using Binaryen while preserving the debugging information required for such tasks.
